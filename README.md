## CSC-317 - HTML Individual Assignment

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment. You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

Create a website entirely in HTML on any (class appropriate) topic. The focus is to get the skeleton of an HTML page. No CSS, and no Javascript.

The site must be coded by hand (i.e. no using HTML generators)

The site must have a home page (index.html).  There must be another page that is an about page, and a contact page.  All pages, images, etc. must be within the public directory.

**_The home page:_**  has to have a nice look and at least 3 images on it.  You should be able to navigate from any page on the site to any other page of the site and navigation should be consistent.

**_The about page:_**  should have similar navigation to the home page and information about the site (and about you, name, SFSU ID, github name).

**_The contact page:_**  should have an HTML form (obviously it will not do anything, since we have no backend), but should have at least the following fields:
> 		First Name
> 		Last Name
> 		Email Address
> 		Street Address
> 		City
> 		State (drop down)
> 		ZipCode
> 		Password
		
Then it should have at **_least 4 more fields_** you decide.
The fields should be laid out in a user friendly fashion and be appropriate type fields with appropriate HTML error checking. Note the state field should have all states.

**_Extra Credit:_**	Do additional relevant pages to your site that contain unique elements (such as an FAQ page).

Like out first assignment you will run `node server317.js` to start the webserver which will again be at `localhost:3000`.

Submission:  All the files should be organized and submitted to github from the assigned repository (all files within the public sub-directory).  A PDF writeup (use template) that includes a description of what you did, the logic and design of what you did, problems encountered and how you overcame them and screen shots of your pages (use a full page for each screen shot). 

The PDF must be included in your repository AND also submitted to Canvas.
